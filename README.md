# glasshouse bar hit bot

https://sabe.io/tutorials/how-to-build-discord-bot-typescript

todo:
>> 1. looping through player and hits json
2. command options type -> number/string types etc (register, placehit, removehit, etc any method that takes an option)
>> (semi fixed?) 2. checking if player is in array -> database (findPlayer), placehit, removehit, claimhit
fix /register,  not working. also player data tracking!!!

commands:
* placehit
* removehit
* listhits
* claimhit
* hello
* register
* listplayers
